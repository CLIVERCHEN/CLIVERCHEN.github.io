My research interests lie at the intersection of **reinforcement learning**, **large language models**, and **AI for healthcare**.

### Reinforcement Learning
I study safe and efficient reinforcement learning algorithms, with a focus on offline-to-online transfer, constrained decision-making, and robustness in real-world environments.

### Large Language Models
I am interested in integrating large language models with decision-making systems, including reasoning, planning, and alignment with human feedback.

### AI for Healthcare
I explore applications of machine learning and reinforcement learning in healthcare, such as medical data analysis and clinical decision support.
