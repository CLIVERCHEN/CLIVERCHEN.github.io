I am a first-year PhD student in Electrical Engineering at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/), advised by [Prof. Shaofeng Zou](https://sites.google.com/view/szou/home).

My research focuses on reinforcement learning, large language models, and their applications to healthcare, with particular interest in safe and efficient reinforcement learning and constrained decision-making.

Previously, I received my B.Eng. in Automation from [Xi’an Jiaotong University](https://www.xjtu.edu.cn/).
